## Lecture outline

What does the term "data science" mean to you?

So we have three terms here:
- Statistics
- Machine learning (ML)
- Data science
How are they different from each other? For example, what is the difference between a "statistical model" and a "machine learning model?" Or maybe they are the same thing? Just fancy words to be created to confuse people?

What is "learning" as in machine learning?

What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? (Q1 in Quiz #1)

## Group discussion & demo topics

1. Can you implement Q3 in Quiz #1 and show me the histogram?
2. Get the data necessary for doing Exercise 4.2 in Hsieh's book.
